### Understanding the `.pixel-art` Block

The `.pixel-art` block is designed as a **miniature digital canvas** where users can create simple pixel art. Here's a breakdown of its purpose and intended functionality:

---

### Core Concept: Pixel Art Creator
A simplified version of classic pixel art tools (like MS Paint) where users can:
1. Select colors
2. "Paint" on a grid
3. Reset their artwork
4. Preview their creation

---

### Key Components & Functionality

1. **Color Picker Tool** (`.pixel-art__color-picker`)
   - User selects active drawing color
   - Default: Red (#ff0000)

2. **Grid Canvas** (`.pixel-art__grid`)
   - 8×8 grid of paintable cells
   - Each cell (`.pixel-art__cell`) represents one pixel

3. **Action Buttons** (`.pixel-art__action--clear`)
   - Clear button resets all pixels to default (white)

4. **Preview Area** (`.pixel-art__preview-box`)
   - Shows a miniature version of the artwork
   - Updates in real-time as user paints

---

### User Stories / Expected Behavior

1. **As an artist**, I want to:
   - Click any grid cell to paint it with my selected color
   - Change colors mid-drawing using the color picker
   - See my artwork update in the preview area instantly
   - Clear the entire canvas with one button click

2. **Example Workflow**:
   - User selects purple from color picker
   - Clicks 5 grid cells to draw a flower shape
   - Changes to green and adds a stem
   - Preview box shows miniature flower
   - Clicks "Clear" to start a new drawing

---

### Visual Feedback Mechanics
1. **Hover States**:
   - Cells slightly enlarge on hover (visual affordance)
   - Cursor changes to pointer (indicates interactivity)

2. **Painting Feedback**:
   - Immediate color change on click
   - Preview updates synchronously

3. **Tool Indicators**:
   - Color picker shows current color
   - Clear button has hover effect

---

### Technical Implementation Notes (for your JS)

1. **Grid Handling**:
   - Each cell needs click event listener
   - Store color state per cell (data attribute or class)

2. **Color Management**:
   - Track current color from picker's `value`
   - Apply color to clicked cells' `background`

3. **Preview System**:
   - Options:
     a) Scale down grid visually (CSS transform)
     b) Replicate grid state in preview box
     c) Generate image preview (more advanced)

4. **Clear Function**:
   - Reset all cells to default background
   - Clear preview area

---

### Design Philosophy
1. **Low Barrier to Entry**:
   - Intuitive for beginners
   - No complex tools (only color + clear)

2. **Instant Gratification**:
   - Immediate visual feedback
   - Small canvas encourages quick creations

3. **Mobile-Friendly**:
   - Large touch targets
   - Responsive grid sizing

---

### Potential Enhancements (Post-Core)
1. Save/load artwork
2. Shareable links
3. Color palette presets
4. Different grid sizes
5. Drawing tools (bucket fill, eraser)

This block is designed to be a fun, interactive element that goes beyond static content while providing rich opportunities for DOM manipulation practice. The simplicity of the 8×8 grid makes it approachable while still allowing creative expression.
