        <p>Here we celebrate two very different — yet oddly related — cookies:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the golden-brown treats that make kitchens smell like grandma’s house, and</li>
            <li>the tiny text files that make your favorite websites remember who you are.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Grab a mug of something warm, settle in, and let’s explore why life (and the Internet) is simply better with
            cookies.</p>

        <h2 class="main__title">Part&nbsp;1&nbsp;|&nbsp;Edible Cookies — Small Bites of Happiness</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are sweet, bite-sized treats that can be dropped, molded, sliced, or baked in bars, with classics
            like chocolate-chip, oatmeal-raisin, and peanut-butter leading the list. A trendy variation is edible cookie
            dough, which leaves out raw eggs and uses heat-treated flour so you can enjoy the dough straight from the
            bowl without worrying about food-borne germs. Heating the flour to 160 °F and skipping eggs removes the
            usual salmonella and E. coli risks.

        <h3 class="main__subtitle">1. A Brief History</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Origin: Persian bakers experimented with sugar around the 7th century.</li>
            <li>Name: From the Dutch word “koekje,” meaning “little cake.”</li>
            <li>Voyage: Dutch settlers carried the idea to New Amsterdam (modern-day NYC), and the U.S. cookie craze
                never looked back.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="main__subtitle">2. Main Cookie Styles</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Drop cookies — Classic chocolate-chip, oatmeal-raisin.</li>

            <li>Bar cookies — Blondies, brownies, seven-layer magic bars.</li>
            <li>Refrigerator (slice-and-bake) cookies — Pinwheels, shortbread.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3 class="main__subtitle">3. The Simple Anatomy of a Cookie</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour for structure</li>
            <li>Fat (butter or oil) for tenderness and flavor</li>
            <li>Sugar for sweetness and caramelization</li>
            <li>Eggs for richness and binding</li>
            <li>Leaveners (baking soda/powder) for lift</li>
            <li>Add-ins for personality: chocolate chips, nuts, dried fruit, sprinkles</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="main__subtitle">4. Fool-Proof Basic Recipe</h3>

            <li>Cool, share, repeat.</li>
        </ol>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="main__title">Part&nbsp;2&nbsp;|&nbsp;Web Cookies — Tiny Files With a Big Job</h2>
        <p>
            In the online world, a cookie is a tiny text file that a website’s server places in your browser. Every time
            your browser visits that site again, it automatically sends the cookie back so the server can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>remember you’re signed in or keep items in your shopping cart</li>
            <li>load pages in your preferred language or color theme</li>
            <li>measure which pages you read and for how long to improve the site’s content</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A web-cookie normally holds just a small ID number—about 4 KB or less—that ties your browser to the right
            account or settings; it does not contain the baked-good kind of chocolate chips.
        </p>
        <h3 class="main__subtitle">1. Common Types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Session cookies — Temporary; vanish when you close the browser.</li>
            <li>Persistent cookies — Stay until a set expiration date, keeping you logged in or remembering settings.
            </li>
            <li>First-party cookies — Set by the site you’re on; generally useful for user experience.</li>
            <li>Third-party cookies — Set by external services (ads, analytics) that can track you across sites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="main__subtitle">2. Why Sites Use Cookies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Authentication — Stay signed in without typing your password on every page.</li>
            <li>Personalization — Language choice, dark mode, cart contents.</li>
            <li>Analytics — Measure traffic so site owners know what to improve.</li>
            <li>Marketing — Show ads related to items you actually looked at (sometimes handy, sometimes creepy).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="main__subtitle">3. Your Privacy &amp; Control</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most modern browsers let you block or erase cookies in Settings → Privacy.</li>
            <li>Incognito/Private mode stores cookies only for the current session.</li>
            <li>EU residents see consent banners because of GDPR regulations.</li>
            <li>Deleting cookies might sign you out of your favorite sites, so manage them selectively.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="main__title">The Takeaway</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re dunking a chewy chocolate chip into cold milk or clicking through an online store that
            remembers what size you wear, cookies exist to make life smoother and sweeter. Handle both types
            wisely—share the baked ones generously, and manage the digital ones consciously—and you’ll enjoy the best of
            each world.</p>

        <p>Now that you’ve reached the end of the page, why not:</p>
