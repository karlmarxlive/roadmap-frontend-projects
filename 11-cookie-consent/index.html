        <h2>Cookies in the kitchen</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are sweet, bite-sized treats that can be dropped, molded, sliced, or baked in bars, with classics like chocolate-chip, oatmeal-raisin, and peanut-butter leading the list. A trendy variation is edible cookie dough, which leaves out raw eggs and uses heat-treated flour so you can enjoy the dough straight from the bowl without worrying about food-borne germs. Heating the flour to 160 °F and skipping eggs removes the usual salmonella and E. coli risks.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies on the web</h2>
        <p>
            In the online world, a cookie is a tiny text file that a website’s server places in your browser. Every time your browser visits that site again, it automatically sends the cookie back so the server can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>remember you’re signed in or keep items in your shopping cart</li>
            <li>load pages in your preferred language or color theme</li>
            <li>measure which pages you read and for how long to improve the site’s content</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A web-cookie normally holds just a small ID number—about 4 KB or less—that ties your browser to the right account or settings; it does not contain the baked-good kind of chocolate chips.
