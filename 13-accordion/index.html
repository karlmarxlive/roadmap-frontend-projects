                        <p>roadmap.sh contains community-curated roadmaps, study plans, paths, and resources for developers. There are role-based roadmaps, listing skills you should know for any given role, as well as skill-based roadmaps listing items to learn for any given skill.</p>
                        <p>It started as a set of visual charts on GitHub to guide developers who are confused about what they should learn next, but then expanded into interactive roadmaps where you can click and get resources to learn any given resource, contribute by adding new roadmaps, suggest changes to existing roadmaps, track your progress as you follow a roadmap and so on.</p>

                        <p>Our long-term plan is to make roadmap.sh a go-to place for developers whenever they plan on learning something new. We started with roadmaps, guides, videos and other visual content but we plan on introducing best practices, best-practices for certain tasks, quizzes to test your knowledge and prepare yourself for the interviews, project ideas to work on while following the roadmaps, public profiles to share your progress and interact with the other learners and so on.</p>
